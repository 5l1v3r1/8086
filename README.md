# Simple Assembly Language Programs based on 8086

-------------------------------------------------
# About 

- Assembly language is a low level programming language.These programs are intended for those who are familiar with assembler, or have a bit of idea about it. Of course if you have knowledge of some other programming language (Basic, C/C++, Pascal ...) that may help you a lot.But even if you are familiar with assembler, it is still a good idea to look through this document in order to study Emu8086 syntax.
